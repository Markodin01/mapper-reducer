(2) we introduce a profile hidden markov model (phmm) built on the shape curvature sequence descriptor to improve the segmentation of specific objects. the special states and structure of phmms allow considerable shape contour perturbations and provide efficient inference and learning algorithms for shape modeling. further embedding of the phmm parameters captures the long term spatial dependencies on a shape profile, hence the global characteristics of a shape class. (3) we incorporate the proposed methods in a spatio-temporal mrf model to solve the video-based object segmentation problem. our new model is a simultaneous object segmentation, background modeling, and pose estimation framework, which combines the top-down high-level object shape constraints with the bottom-up low-level image cues, and features a flexible graph structure induced by the motion information for more reliable temporal smoothness. we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of all our methods in a wide variety of thorough experiments."},
